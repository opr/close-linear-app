This is a Tampermonkey user script to close the [Linear web app](https://linear.app/) after clicking a link on the web before it opens the desktop app.

The tab is supposed to auto close according to Linear, but sometimes it doesn't.

## Installation

- Click the `close-linear.js` file in the repository and then click "Raw" in the top right of the file view.
- Copy the contents of the script into a new Tampermonkey script and save it.
